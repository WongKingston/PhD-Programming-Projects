5v46 Final
This script contains functions that generate data that mocks a rat breeding.
This is followed by syntax to generate mock behavioral and biomarker data relevant to my own thesis project.
Next, there is a function that conducts independent T-tests on an variable between Ethanols and Controls from the Final dataset
Lastly, there is syntax to visualize the behavioral and biomarker data, as well as Dendrograms and scatter plots to identify and visualize clusters in the dataset.
